After getting the project from SVN you will need to initialize 
the local plugin directory in Eclipse.

These steps will do that:

1. Import into Eclipse as a Maven project. NOTE: Make sure the src/main/resources
   has all its directories on the classpath! (In some versions of Elipse and/or STS
   this in NOT the default for imported maven projects).

2. From the command line mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true package

3. Copy/edit template.build.properties to build.properties (points to local Cytoscape 
   download; we are currently using Cytoscape 2.8.0). 

4. Run the file InstallPluginsBuild.xml as ant build (this will create a local copy of 
   the plugins in directory in the target directory in your Eclipse project you only 
   need to do this once now, and any time you delete/clean the targets directory).
   ant -file InstallPluginsBuild.xml

5. Create/Edit a new run configuration, pointed at the Eclipse project that runs main 
   class cytoscape.CyMain with program arguments -p target/plugins (I also set the VM 
   arguments to -Xms512m -Xmx512m)
